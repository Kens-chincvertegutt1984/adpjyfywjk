Dude, just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 Contraataque and like... wow. I mean, talk about a rollercoaster. One minute I'm laughing, next second I'm all wait, what?! You know how it is when you're super into something but also kinda tired 'cause life is nuts and you maybe 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 it way too late at night? Yeah, that. Anyway, the plot was all over the place, but in a good way, if that makes any sense. Plot twists were like BAM, slap in the face, wake up call kind of thing.

Bro, there's this part where I legit was like, Did that really just happen? 😂 Like, I'm questioning my life choices now because why did I not 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   sooner? Srsly. But I finally got around to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 it and just, wow. I won’t spoil anything just yet, but there’s this scene and I might have yelled at my screen. Hashtag no regrets.

>The characters though, some of them are total mood swings on legs. One moment all chill, the next they’re flipping out like someone took the last slice of pizza. And the dialogues, man... some were pure gold, others felt like they came out of a soap opera, but that just adds to the charm, you feel me?

Also, the soundtrack... killer. Kinda made me want to get up and dance but, like, I was too comfy under my blanket. Priorities, right? 😂 But all jokes aside, it's one of those  s that kinda sneaks its way into your brain, and you end up thinking about it randomly when you’re, I dunno, making coffee or something.

Speaking of which, there's this bit where—okay, I have to stop. Almost spoiled the ending, geez. Anyway, definitely check it out if you haven't already. 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   and tell me if you feel the existential dread after that ending lol. It’s honestly a trip.

int i = 0; i++;

And now I'm just sitting here trying to process what I just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥, but my brain's like nah, fam, we're tapping out. Might re𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it next weekend or maybe not, depends on how many life crises I feel like tackling in one week.
